        <h1>How do we work?</h1>
        <p>The premier goal for a seafood restaurant is the same 
        for any business -- make a profit. The restaurant industry 
        generates $660 billion dollars a year as of 2012. Nearly all,
         93 percent of the locations, have 50 or fewer employees according
          to the National Restaurant Association. Seafood restaurants may 
          4be family-oriented, fast food or gourmet dining experiences. 
          No matter what type of seafood restaurant you own, setting goals
           and establishing strategies to achieve the goals are important 
           keys to success</p>
